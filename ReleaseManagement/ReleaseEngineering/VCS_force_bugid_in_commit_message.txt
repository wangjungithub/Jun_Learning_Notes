Some people like to force that each commit has a bug id, some others don't.
copy some interesting opinions below. Personally I agree to not force, but provide the option to each project team, which might be easy for teams to take

-----------------
My personal opinion (I really want to stress the personal part) is that
it's a silly restriction, but a nice feature.  If I want to link a commit
to a bug, I want it to be easy.  If it's not necessary, I want to stop
seeing bugs filed that are called "I opened this bug so I can commit
something".

Forcing people to file a bug for every commit either leads to silly
placeholder bugs, or it leads to people committing less often because of
the hassle.  Committing less often hinders continuous integration and
leads to larger, more difficult to roll back or merge commits.


-----------------
I had people request "write a plugin that doesn't let people say just
"abc" as a check-in message!" and finally got tired of it and released
a svn plugin that let people define their own rules in the config files.


-----------------
I don't understand the reluctance to use a feature that cost you nothing
and you can only benefit from.
I don't ask to require ticket ids in commit messages but that if someone
does refer to tickets, the change will appear in the ticket.

In such a large org there's a benefit for the visibility of changes. I
don't have time to go through the svn/git log and see what my peers
committed. When I get emails from bugzilla I can easily see if I care
about the change or not.

There's great benefit in standardization. People know what to expect.

Pushing against standards without a good reason is a bad thing imo.
