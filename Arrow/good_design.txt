I think Arrow has many good architect design on below perspectives:

01. config/config.js, and combine with command line options

02. High coverage UT, used some mock technologies like YUI Test mock and mockery

03. In source documentation, with RST format (recognized by github)

04. CLI and lib seperation

05. Customer controller, for kind of customization
