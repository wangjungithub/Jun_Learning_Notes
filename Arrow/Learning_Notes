Target: Variable sharing between controllers and tests
  . There should be a global testParams for each test
  . global testParams should be shared between controller(s) and test(s)

About testParams

. Where is testParams from (where it is constructed)?


. How controller and TestSession get testParams?

   . Arrow Controller gets testConfig and testParams from its constructor
   . Controller is created in Arrow:runController, testConfig/testParams are from runController parameters
   . Arrow.runController is called by TestSession:runTest, parameters are from TestSession constructor, args.config/args.params;
   . TestSession is created in SessionFactory:runTest, test object, test.config is usually empty, test.parms is from args, which is from SessionFactory constructor;
   . SessionFactory constructor args is from Arrow construcotr, which is from index.js command line options (argv);
