Target: Variable sharing between controllers and tests
  . There should be a global testParams for each test
  . global testParams should be shared between controller(s) and test(s)

About testParams

. Where is testParams from (where it is constructed)?


. How controller and TestSession get testParams?

   . Arrow Controller gets testConfig and testParams from its constructor
   . Controller is created in Arrow:runController, testConfig/testParams are from runController parameters
   . Arrow.runController is called by TestSession:runTest, parameters are from TestSession constructor, args.config/args.params;
   . TestSession is created in SessionFactory:runTest, test object, test.config is usually empty, test.parms is from args, 
        which is from SessionFactory constructor;
   . SessionFactory constructor args is from Arrow construcotr, which is from index.js command line options (argv);

. Where are the testParams being used?


   . For server side testing
      . nodejs/node.js
         . It is passed from lib/driver/node.js, using in forked process, so it cannot be shared with others.

      . lib/driver/node.js ( NodeDriver:executeTest() )
         . It is function parameter, the function is called by DefaultController:execute()

   . For client side testing
      . lib/driver/selenium.js
         . testParams are passed to SeleniumDriver:executeTest(), and used in other internal functions.
         . executeTest() is called by Controller:execute()

   . lib/controller/default.js ( DefaultController:execute() )
     . The testParams is got from constructor, saved to this.testPrarms, and used by executeScenario() and execute()
     . The DefaultController is newed in Arrow:runController()

   . lib/interface/arrow.js ( Arrow:runController() )
      . It is a function parameter, the function is called by TestSession:runTest()

   . lib/session/testsession.js ( TestSession:runTest() )
      . The testParams are from TestSession constructor, it is newed in SessionFactory:runAllTestSessions()

   . lib/session/sessionfactory.js ( SessionFactory:runAllTestSessions() )
      . If arrow is ran with a test descriptor, testParams are parsed from descriptor file;
      . Otherwise, testParams is initialized in SessionFactory:startTest()



. What are in the testParams?
